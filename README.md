### Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, aiming to gain valuable insights into the provided data. The analysis covers various aspects, including data understanding, exploration, time-based analysis, user analysis, transaction types, amount distribution, insights, and recommendations. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that can inform decision-making and strategic actions.

### Tools Used
Excel for Data Cleaning
Power BI for creating dashboard
SQL for analysis
Python for Model Building

### Work Process
1. Data Understanding
* Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Displayed the initial rows to understand the dataset's structure.
* Checked for missing values and verified data types.

2. Data Exploration
* Calculated basic summary statistics for numerical columns, focusing on AMOUNT.
* Explored the distribution of TRANSACTION_TYPE, CURRENCY, and TYPE columns.
* Visualized the distribution of AMOUNT using histograms and box plots.

3. Time-Based Analysis
* Converted timestamp columns, CREATED_DATE, and CREATED_DATE minus Hour to datetime format.
* Analyzed the temporal distribution of transactions, identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies.

4. User Analysis
* Identified unique USER_IDs and counted transaction occurrences for each user.
* Explored the distribution of transactions across users.
* Analyzed user behavior, highlighting common transaction types and preferred currencies.

5. Transaction Types and Amounts
Analyzed the distribution of transaction types (TYPE) and currencies (CURRENCY).
Calculated total transaction amounts for different types and currencies.
Visualized results using bar plots and pie charts.

6. Amount Distribution by Transaction Type
* Utilized box plots and violin plots to compare transaction amount distributions across different transaction types.

7. Insights and Patterns
* Explored the data for recurring patterns, anomalies, or trends.
* Formulated hypotheses about user behavior, transaction patterns, and anomalies.

8. Data Visualization
* Created various visualizations, including line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots.
* Highlighted key insights and observations from the visualizations.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this analysis has provided valuable insights into the dataset. I observed several interesting trends and patterns related to user behavior, transaction types, and currency preferences.
